It asks the questions: how can the traditional reading experience be transformed using such tools as interaction design, development, and illustration? How can multi-media enhance the emotionality of a writing piece? <br> <br>By these approaches, the reader is invited to step into the narrator’s shoes, sit down at the computer, and experience words unsend. </p> <div class="about__credit">All writing, design, and <a href="https://github.com/julietennett" target="_blank">code</a> by <a href="https://julietennett.github.io/" target="_blank">Julie Tennett</a></div> </div> </div> <div class="footer"> <a class="about"> ABOUT THIS PROJECT </a> <div class="credit">designed and built w/ &hearts; by julie tennett, 2018</div> </div> </body> </html>
