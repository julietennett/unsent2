        <p class="description__text">This piece explores hybrid writing through the lens of digital experiences. It asks the questions: how can the traditional reading experience be transformed using such tools as interaction design, development, and illustration? How can multi-media enhance the emotionality of a writing piece? <br>
          <br>By these approaches, the reader is invited to step into the narratorâ€™s shoes, sit down at the computer, and experience words unsend. </p>
