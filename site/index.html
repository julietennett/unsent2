          <p>It's been a long time, I know it has. But I managed to get to the restaurant. I may have avoided eye contact as best as I could, allowing my eyes to dart away from yours, hands wringing in my lap away from your line of sight, mind racing and blank all at the same time. (How is that even possible? Having so much too say and nothing at all to say, all at the same time.)
            <br>
            <br>But I was there, sitting across from you in the crowded restaurant as our waiter interupted the hesitant conversation developing between us. My hair was cut short and it's a different color than you saw last. You told me you didn't recognize it.
            <br>
            <br>You see, I'm new now. A new person. I'm not who you used to know.
            <br>
            <br>Can't you tell by my hair?
            <br>
            <br>So it was you and the New Me, we placed our orders, and we no longer had menus to stare at with just a little too much intensity. So you started talking again, and suddenly we were laughing.
            <br>
            <br>I could hear myself laughing, as if I were the waiter walking by with a  greeting as he hurried to the next table. It was a sound I recognized, a familiar feeling in my gut that I hadn't felt in so many months. And suddenly I could see myself again, through all of the doors I pulled shut between us.
            <br>
            <br>When I am with you, I am myself. It's always been that way, but I don't think you knew that. I don't think you knew that every time you looked at me, laughed with me, prompted me, I felt myself growing more and more familiar. And our plates arrived, and our food dwindled, and nothing was left but to call the check.
            <br>
            <br>I didn't want to go.
            <br>
            <br>When dinner was over, you walked away in the middle of a sentence. And now I have to go back to being the New Me again. I might cut my hair."</p>
