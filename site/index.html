            <p class="email1 hide">It's been a long time, I know it has. But I managed to get to the restaurant. I may have avoided eye contact as best as I could, but I was there, sitting across from you.<br>
              <br>My hair was cut short and it's a different color than you saw last. You didn't recognize it. You see, I'm new now: a new person. I'm not who you used to know. Can't you tell by my hair?<br>
              <br>But you started talking. Of course you did, we were at dinner together. You and the New Me. You started talking and I could hear myself laughing. I could hear my laughter and it was the same as it was when I got to hear you talk every day. And suddenly I could see myself again, through all of the doors I pulled shut between us. With you, I am myself. I don't know what it is, but something clicks into place when I hear you talk and suddenly I am who I always have been. Being there felt familiar and broken and I wanted to stay as long as I could.<br>
              <br>When dinner was over, you walked away in the middle of a sentence. And now I have to go back to being the new me again. I might cut my hair.</p>
          <!-- email 02 -->
            <p class="email2 hide">I found myself in the park tonight surrounded by a crowd of people. There were people everywhere, coming together to sing and chant and cheer, a sense of comraderie and excitement everyone could feel. Amidst all of the chaos in the park, you were the farthest thing from my mind, but then I looked over to my side and somehow you were there.<br>
              <br>You were actually there! How did you manage to find the one spot next to mine? For a moment, my mind flashed to the time when I believed the universe pulled your atoms towards mine, with some sort of cosmic attraction (those are words I actually thought in my mind, can you believe that?)<br>
              <br>The last time we were in that park together, it was summertime. We laid in the grass, allowing the sunshine to hit our faces until we both had sunburns. I wrote about it in my journal that night and I said "I could've lived in that moment forever." <br>
              <br>I looked over again and you and your friends had moved further into the crowd, out of my sight. </p>
            <p class="email3 hide">I saw you ride by me on a bike I've never seen before. I had to squint to tell if it was you, but you looked away before I could figure it out. As I walked to class I started to rehearse all of the things I never got to say. I could finally yell, louder and louder as the retorts I knew you would have spat at me rung through my head. And my chest felt tight as I sat in my chair. The lecture began and I couldn't hear us anymore. </p>
            <p class="email4 hide">I remembered when I last saw you drunk as I watched you flirt with a girl across the bar tonight. That time, a whole year ago (or has it been longer?), you insisted you needed me next to you, and you wouldn't stop until I crossed the livingroom and took a seat beside you. I was the only thing you needed, you said. You didn't see me at the bar tonight but the next time I turned my head you were standing next to me and your lips were on hers.</p>
            <p class="email5 hide">It's been approximately 4 months since we last spoke before today. 4 months of silence, and 4 more months before that. And it's been almost a year since you last got VIP access to my thoughts. And yet, I sat down at the table today with the two friends we could both do a better job staying in touch with. I had a coffee in my hand and the first thing you said was "I thought you stopped drinking coffee!" <br>
              <br>It's been one year since I've told you I stopped drinking coffee. But you remembered that afternoon conversation. And you didn't realized I went on that melodramatic anti-coffee rant knowing I would only last in my coffee abstention for maybe a month. But you weren't around a month later to find out. You thought I was more dedicated to the coffeeless cause. And you remembered.</p>
