              <br>My hair was cut short and it's a different color than you saw last. You didn't recognize it. You see, I'm new now: a new person. I'm not who you used to know. Can't you tell by my hair?<br>
              <br>But you started talking. Of course you did, we were at dinner together. You and the New Me. You started talking and I could hear myself laughing. I could hear my laughter and it was the same as it was when I got to hear you talk every day. And suddenly I could see myself again, through all of the doors I pulled shut between us. With you, I am myself. I don't know what it is, but something clicks into place when I hear you talk and suddenly I am who I always have been. Being there felt familiar and broken and I wanted to stay as long as I could.<br>
              <br>When dinner was over, you walked away in the middle of a sentence. And now I have to go back to being the new me again. I might cut my hair.</p>
